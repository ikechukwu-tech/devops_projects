# DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION
in previous project we implemented a wordpress based solution that is ready to be filed with content and that can be used as a full fledged website or blog. moving futher we will add some more value to our solutions that your devops team could utilize . we want to introduce a set of tools that will help our devop team in day to day activity, in managing developing , testing and monitoring different projects.

the tool we want our team  to be able to use is well known  and widely used by multiple devops team, so we would introduce a sigle devops tooling solution  that will consist of :
1. jenkings - free and open source automation server used to build `CI/CD` pipeline
2. kubernetes - an open source container-orchastration system for automating computer application , deployment and scalling and management.
3. jfrog Artifactory - universal repository manager supporting all major packaging formats , build tools and `CI` servers  AR=rtifactory.
4. Rancher - an open souce software plateform that enables organization to run and manage `Docker` and `Kubernetes ` in production .
5. Granfana- a multi plateform open sourse analysics  and interactive vitualization  web application.
6. Prometheus- an open source monitoring system with a dimentional data model, flexible quary language , efficient time series database and mordern alarting approach.
7. Kibana -is a free and open user interface that lets you vitualise your `ELASTIC SEARCH` data and navigate the `ELASTIC STACK`




`NOTE`: donot feel overwhelmed by all the tool and technologies listed above , we will gradually get pourselfes familiar with them in up comming projects.

`SIDE SELF STUDY`
# READ ABOUT
1. network attached storage {`NAS`}, storage area network{`san`} and related protocols like NFS[S],FTP, SMB,ISCSI, explore what `block level storage`and how it is used by cloud service providers, know the difference from object storage. on the example of AWS service, understand the different between block storage ,object storage and network file system.

`SETUP THE TECHNOLOGY USED IN THIS PROJECT`
As a member of a devops team, you will implement a tooling website solution which makes access to DevOps tools within the corporate infrastructure easily accessable.
in this project you will implement a solution that consist of the following components

1. infrastructure AWS
